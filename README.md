--> Reverse Number â€“ Spring Boot REST API

This project demonstrates how to convert a basic Java program into a real-world REST API using Spring Boot. It takes an integer as input and returns the reversed number as output.
Instead of running the logic in a console application, the reverse logic is exposed via a GET API endpoint. It can be easily tested using a browser or tools like Postman.

Example:
   Input: 12345
   Output: 54321

Built With:
 1. Java 17+
 2. Spring Boot
 3. Spring Web
 4. Postman for API Testing


Features:
 1. Clean REST Controller using @GetMapping
 2. Lightweight and fast to run
 3. Customizable port via application.properties
